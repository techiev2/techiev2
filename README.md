## வணக்கம், this is Sriram Velamur; aka [techiev2](https://techiev2.in)

### An engineer, poet, above all, a philosopher.

- 🗞 In an earlier life, I built tech to enable [crisp](https://getcrisp.news) news summaries.
- ✏️ In an alternative life that vies for attention, I write poetry and philosophy.
- 🥳 Eclectic mix of life-sciences where I started, to AI/ML and general human psyche.
